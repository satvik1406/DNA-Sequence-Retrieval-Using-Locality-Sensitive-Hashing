# DNA-Sequence-Retrieval-Using-Locality-Sensitive-Hashing


Model Used : Locality Sensitive Hashing
Please follow the steps to create a model, process it and perform information retrieval 

Step 1: Creating a text document of the dataset

	1. Each line should contain a DNA sequence.
	2. You can use additional attribute such as class as a space separated value in each line.

Step 2: Install all the necessary packages. 

Step 3: Query Processing.

	1. Now run the query.py file.
	2. It loads the data, makes shingles, performs minHashing, generates candidate pairs and finally printout the similar pairs.
	3. Input the query and get the results.
